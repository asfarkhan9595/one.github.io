            <h1>Blockchain for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</h1>
            <p>Decentralized finance—often called DeFi—refers to the shift from traditional, centralized financial
                systems to peer-to-peer finance enabled by decentralized technologies built on the Ethereum blockchain.
                From lending and borrowing platforms to stablecoins and tokenized BTC, the DeFi ecosystem has launched
                an expansive network of integrated protocols and financial instruments. Now with over $13 billion worth
                of value locked in Ethereum smart contracts, decentralized finance has emerged as the most active sector
                in the blockchain space, with a wide range of use cases for individuals, developers, and institutions.
                .</p>

                applications, and solutions for enterprises and governments that determined to harness the power of
                Ethereum. The organization was referred to by The New Yorker in 2018 as “the Ethereum community’s most
                prominent and ubiquitous developer and promoter of decentralized apps.”</p><br>
